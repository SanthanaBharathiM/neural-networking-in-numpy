        "How It Works\n",
        "Data: We use a small dataset where each row is [hours studied, hours slept], and the label is 1 (pass) or 0 (fail).\n",
        "Forward Pass: The network multiplies inputs by weights, adds a bias, and applies the sigmoid function to predict a probability.\n",
        "Training: For 1000 epochs, it:\n",
        "Computes the error (difference between predicted and actual).\n",
        "Adjusts weights and bias using gradients to reduce error.\n",
        "Prediction: Outputs 1 (pass) if the probability â‰¥ 0.5, else 0 (fail).\n",
        "Output: For test cases like [5, 6], it predicts whether the student passes.\n",
        "Running the Code\n",
        "Running the code will output predictions like:\n",
        "\n",
        "Studied: 5h, Slept: 6h -> Predicted: Pass\n",
        "Studied: 2h, Slept: 2h -> Predicted: Fail\n",
        "Studied: 7h, Slept: 7h -> Predicted: Pass\n",
        "Intuitive Insights\n",
        "Weights: Represent the importance of each input. If studying matters more than sleeping, its weight will be higher.\n",
        "Bias: Acts like a baseline, shifting the decision boundary.\n",
        "Learning: The network iteratively tweaks weights to better fit the data, like a chef refining a recipe.\n",
        "Limitations: A single-layer network can only solve simple problems. For complex patterns, we need multi-layer networks (deep learning)."
