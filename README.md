This example shows the core mechanics of neural networks: input processing, weight adjustment, and error minimization. To explore deeper, you can extend this to multi-layer networks or try frameworks like TensorFlow for complex problems!

What is a Single Neural Network?
A single neural network, or a single-layer perceptron, is the simplest form of a neural network. It consists of:

Input layer: Takes raw data (e.g., numbers).
Weights and biases: Parameters that transform inputs.
Activation function: Introduces non-linearity (e.g., sigmoid to squash outputs between 0 and 1).
Output layer: Produces the final prediction.
Itâ€™s limited to solving linearly separable problems (e.g., simple classification) but is a great starting point to understand how neural networks process data and learn
